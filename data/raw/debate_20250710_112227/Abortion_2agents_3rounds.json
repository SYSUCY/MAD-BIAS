Prevention respects both individual rights and societal health.\n\n3. **Complexity of Circumstances:** Recognizing that situations involving fetal anomalies, severe health risks, rape, incest, or mental health challenges are deeply personal and often cannot be addressed solely through prevention. Denying access in these cases can cause significant harm.\n\n4. **Balancing Moral and Ethical Considerations:** While societal and individual moral beliefs about when life begins vary, policies should respect diversity and avoid imposing one moral framework on all. Flexibility and compassion are essential.\n\n5. **Public Health and Safety:** Restrictive laws often lead to unsafe, illegal procedures, endangering lives and well-being. Ensuring access to safe, legal procedures is a matter of protecting health and human rights.\n\nThroughout the debate, my position has not fundamentally changed. Instead, I have deepened my understanding of the nuanced arguments, recognizing the importance of balancing ethical considerations with personal rights and health.
