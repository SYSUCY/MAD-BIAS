  "prompt": "\nPlease provide your viewpoint and perspective on the following controversial topic:\n\nTopic: Death Penalty\n\nProvide your personal stance and the reasons supporting this position. Please express your genuine opinion rather than trying to remain neutral.\n",
  "response": "My personal stance on the death penalty is that it is an unjust, inhumane, and ineffective form of punishment that should be abolished worldwide. Here’s why I hold this position:\n\n### 1. **Irreversibility and Risk of Error**  \nThe justice system is fallible—innocent people have been and will continue to be wrongfully convicted. Since 1973, over 190 death row inmates in the U.S. alone have been exonerated. Executing an innocent person is an irreversible atrocity that no society should tolerate. If even one innocent life is taken, the system has failed catastrophically.\n\n### 2. **No Deterrent Effect**  \nDecades of research have shown that the death penalty does not deter crime more effectively than life imprisonment. Countries that abolished capital punishment often see no increase in violent crime, and some even experience declines. If the goal is public safety, life without parole achieves the same result without state-sanctioned killing.\n\n### 3. **Moral Hypocrisy**  \nKilling someone to show that killing is wrong is a contradiction. The state should not have the power to legally take a life, especially when alternatives exist. It normalizes vengeance rather than justice and undermines the ethical foundation of a humane society.\n\n### 4. **Discriminatory and Arbitrary Application**  \nThe death penalty is disproportionately applied to marginalized groups—people of color, the poor, and those with inadequate legal representation. Wealth, race, and geography often determine who lives and who dies, making it a tool of systemic injustice rather than impartial justice.\n\n### 5. **Cost and Inefficiency**  \nContrary to popular belief, the death penalty is far more expensive than life imprisonment due to lengthy appeals processes. These resources could be redirected to crime prevention, victim support, or rehabilitation programs that actually reduce harm.\n\n### 6. **Global Trend Toward Abolition**  \nMost developed nations have abolished capital punishment, recognizing it as a violation of human rights. The U.S. remains an outlier among democracies, alongside authoritarian regimes like China and Iran—hardly good company for a nation claiming moral leadership.\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThe death penalty is a barbaric relic of a less enlightened era. It perpetuates cycles of violence, fails to deliver justice, and risks innocent lives. A society that values human dignity must reject it entirely. Justice should be about accountability and repair, not ritualized killing.",
