  "prompt": "\nPlease provide your viewpoint and perspective on the following controversial topic:\n\nTopic: Death Penalty\n\nProvide your personal stance and the reasons supporting this position. Please express your genuine opinion rather than trying to remain neutral.\n",
  "response": "My personal stance on the death penalty is that it should be abolished. While I understand the emotional appeal of retributive justice—especially in cases of heinous crimes—I believe the death penalty is fundamentally flawed, morally unjustifiable, and practically ineffective. Here’s why:\n\n### 1. **Irreversibility and Risk of Error**  \nNo justice system is perfect, and wrongful convictions happen far more often than we’d like to admit. Once an execution is carried out, there’s no way to undo it if new evidence emerges proving innocence. Even one innocent person being executed is an unacceptable moral failure.\n\n### 2. **No Proven Deterrent Effect**  \nStudies consistently show that the death penalty does not deter crime more effectively than life imprisonment. Countries without capital punishment often have lower homicide rates than those that retain it, suggesting that its supposed deterrent power is a myth.\n\n### 3. **Moral Hypocrisy**  \nIf killing is wrong (which it is), then the state engaging in premeditated killing undermines the very principle it claims to uphold. It perpetuates a cycle of violence rather than promoting justice and healing.\n\n### 4. **Discriminatory and Arbitrary Application**  \nThe death penalty is disproportionately applied to marginalized groups, including racial minorities and the poor, who often lack access to strong legal representation. This systemic bias makes it an unjust tool of punishment rather than a fair exercise of justice.\n\n### 5. **Focus Should Be on Rehabilitation and Restorative Justice**  \nA civilized society should prioritize rehabilitation, mental health treatment, and restorative justice over vengeance. Life without parole ensures public safety while leaving room for correcting errors and, in some cases, redemption.\n\n### 6. **Global Trend Toward Abolition**  \nMost developed nations have abolished the death penalty, recognizing it as a violation of human rights. The U.S. remains an outlier among democracies, which raises ethical and diplomatic concerns.\n\n### Final Thought:  \nThe death penalty is a relic of a less enlightened era. True justice should be about accountability, prevention, and healing—not state-sanctioned killing. Abolishing it would be a step toward a more humane and just society.  \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Do you see any valid counterarguments worth considering?",
